# cardsWithOOD
Name: Sara Filipinas
Date: 6/20/25 (June 20, 2025)
What I added: 
-> I added a card class with constructors, accessors, mutators, and toString methods. 
-> I also added ASCII symbols (♥, ♦, ♣, ♠) to the cards based on the suit to create a visually appealing display when printed.
-> Added a compareTo method to compare cards based on their value.
-> Added a isFaceCard to determine if a card is a face card (Jack, Queen, King, Ace).
